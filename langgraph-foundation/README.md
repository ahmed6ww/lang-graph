## Introduction to LangGraph Agents

**LangGraph** is a robust framework designed to build intelligent agents by integrating language models with graph-based data structures. These agents can perform complex tasks by leveraging the interconnected nature of graphs, allowing for enhanced control, persistence, human interaction, and real-time data streaming. Understanding the core principles of LangGraph is essential for developing reliable and efficient agents.

---

## Core Principles of LangGraph

LangGraph is built upon several foundational pillars that ensure the creation of reliable and controllable agents. Below, we explore each principle in detail.

### 1. Controllability

**Controllability** refers to the developer's ability to manage and direct the agent's behavior and the application's flow meticulously. In LangGraph, this is achieved by representing the application's workflow as a set of **nodes** and **edges**, where:

- **Nodes:** Represent individual tasks or operations.
- **Edges:** Define the flow or relationship between these tasks, allowing for both deterministic and conditional pathways.

**Key Features:**

- **Common State (Memory):** All nodes can access and modify a shared state, enabling coherent data flow and consistency across tasks.
- **Control Flow Management:** Edges can dictate the sequence of operations, including branching logic based on conditions, ensuring that the agent behaves predictably.

**Benefits:**

- Enhanced ability to design complex workflows.
- Improved reliability through structured control flows.
- Flexibility to handle various operational scenarios.

### 2. Persistence

**Persistence** involves the capability to retain the state of the graph and the agent's memory over time. LangGraph provides multiple options for persisting data, ensuring that agents can maintain context and continuity between interactions.

**Key Features:**

- **Short-Term Memory:** Temporary storage for immediate operations and tasks.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Durable storage solutions, such as databases, for retaining information across sessions and interactions.

**Benefits:**

- Enables agents to recall past interactions and maintain context.
- Facilitates continuity in ongoing tasks and projects.
- Supports data recovery and state restoration in case of failures.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop

**Human-in-the-Loop** (HITL) ensures that human oversight and intervention are integral parts of the agent's operation. LangGraph's persistence layer facilitates various HITL interaction patterns, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness.

**Key Features:**

- **Agent Pausing:** Ability to halt agent operations for human review.
- **State Review and Editing:** Humans can inspect and modify the agent's current state before proceeding.
- **Approval Mechanisms:** Humans can authorize subsequent steps, ensuring controlled progression of tasks.

**Benefits:**

- Combines the efficiency of automation with human judgment.
- Increases the reliability and safety of agent operations.
- Allows for corrective actions and fine-tuning by human operators.

### 4. Streaming

**Streaming** in LangGraph refers to the real-time flow of data and events between the agent and users or developers. LangGraph supports streaming of both events and tokens generated by language models, providing dynamic feedback and interaction capabilities.

**Key Features:**

- **Event Streaming:** Real-time transmission of operational events, such as tool invocations or task completions.
- **Token Streaming:** Immediate delivery of tokens (words or phrases) generated by language models, enabling responsive and interactive communication.

**Benefits:**

- Enhances user experience with real-time updates and feedback.
- Facilitates debugging and monitoring through live event streams.
- Supports interactive applications where timely information is crucial.

## Building a Simple Agent in LangGraph

To solidify your understanding of LangGraph's core principles, we'll build a basic agent that demonstrates **Controllability**, **Persistence**, **Human-in-the-Loop**, and **Streaming**. This agent will perform simple tasks such as adding nodes, querying information, and generating descriptions using a language model.

### Setup and Installation

Before we begin, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. We'll use `networkx` for graph operations, `openai` for language model integration, and `pickle` for persistence.

```bash
pip install networkx openai
```

### Defining the Agent

We'll define a `LangGraphAgent` class that encapsulates all core principles. This agent will:

1. **Add and Manage Nodes and Edges (Controllability)**
2. **Persist the Graph State (Persistence)**
3. **Allow Human Interaction (Human-in-the-Loop)**
4. **Stream Event Notifications (Streaming)**

```python
import networkx as nx
import openai
import pickle
import time

# Initialize OpenAI API (replace with your actual API key)
openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

class LangGraphAgent:
    def __init__(self, persistence_file='langgraph_state.pkl'):
        # Initialize a directed graph
        self.graph = nx.DiGraph()
        self.persistence_file = persistence_file
        self.load_state()
        self.memory = {}  # Common state accessible by all nodes

    def add_node(self, node_id, **attributes):
        """Adds a node with given attributes to the graph."""
        self.graph.add_node(node_id, **attributes)
        self.save_state()
        self.stream_event(f"Added node '{node_id}' with attributes {attributes}")

    def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node, **attributes):
        """Adds an edge with given attributes between two nodes."""
        self.graph.add_edge(from_node, to_node, **attributes)
        self.save_state()
        self.stream_event(f"Added edge from '{from_node}' to '{to_node}' with attributes {attributes}")

    def query_node(self, node_id):
        """Retrieves attributes of a specified node."""
        if self.graph.has_node(node_id):
            node_attrs = self.graph.nodes[node_id]
            self.stream_event(f"Queried node '{node_id}': {node_attrs}")
            return node_attrs
        else:
            self.stream_event(f"Query failed: Node '{node_id}' does not exist.")
            return None

    def generate_description(self, node_id):
        """Generates a descriptive summary for a node using OpenAI's language model."""
        node_attrs = self.query_node(node_id)
        if not node_attrs:
            return "Description not available."

        description_parts = [f"{key}: {value}" for key, value in node_attrs.items()]
        prompt = f"Provide a detailed description for the following entity based on its attributes:\n{', '.join(description_parts)}"

        try:
            response = openai.Completion.create(
                engine="text-davinci-003",
                prompt=prompt,
                max_tokens=100,
                temperature=0.7,
                stream=True  # Enable streaming of tokens
            )
            description = ""
            print(f"Generating description for '{node_id}':")
            for chunk in response:
                if 'choices' in chunk:
                    chunk_text = chunk['choices'][0].get('text', '')
                    print(chunk_text, end='', flush=True)
                    description += chunk_text
                    time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate streaming
            print("\n")
            self.stream_event(f"Generated description for '{node_id}'.")
            return description.strip()
        except Exception as e:
            self.stream_event(f"Error generating description for '{node_id}': {e}")
            return "Description not available."

    def save_state(self):
        """Saves the current graph state to a file."""
        with open(self.persistence_file, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(self.graph, f)
        self.stream_event("Graph state saved.")

    def load_state(self):
        """Loads the graph state from a file if it exists."""
        try:
            with open(self.persistence_file, 'rb') as f:
                self.graph = pickle.load(f)
            self.stream_event("Graph state loaded.")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self.stream_event("No existing graph state found. Starting fresh.")

    def human_review(self, node_id):
        """Pauses the agent for human review of a node's state."""
        node_attrs = self.query_node(node_id)
        if not node_attrs:
            self.stream_event(f"Human review failed: Node '{node_id}' does not exist.")
            return

        print(f"\n--- Human Review Required for Node '{node_id}' ---")
        print(f"Current Attributes: {node_attrs}")
        new_role = input("Enter new role (or press Enter to keep current): ")
        if new_role:
            self.graph.nodes[node_id]['role'] = new_role
            self.save_state()
            self.stream_event(f"Human updated role of '{node_id}' to '{new_role}'.")
        print(f"Human review completed for node '{node_id}'.\n")

    def stream_event(self, event_message):
        """Streams event messages to the user."""
        print(f"[STREAM] {event_message}")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = LangGraphAgent()

    # Add nodes
    agent.add_node("Alice", role="Engineer", department="Research and Development")
    agent.add_node("Bob", role="Designer", department="Creative")
    agent.add_node("Company", industry="Technology", founded=2010)

    # Add edges
    agent.add_edge("Alice", "Company", relationship="works_at")
    agent.add_edge("Bob", "Company", relationship="works_at")
    agent.add_edge("Alice", "Bob", relationship="collaborates_with")

    # Query a node
    alice_info = agent.query_node("Alice")
    print(f"\nAlice's Information: {alice_info}\n")

    # Generate description for Company
    company_description = agent.generate_description("Company")
    print(f"Company Description: {company_description}\n")

    # Human-in-the-Loop: Review and update Bob's department
    agent.human_review("Bob")

    # Generate updated description for Bob
    bob_description = agent.generate_description("Bob")
    print(f"Bob Description: {bob_description}\n")
```

### Implementing Core Principles

Let's break down how each core principle is implemented in the `LangGraphAgent` class:

#### 1. Controllability

- **Nodes and Edges:** The agent uses `networkx` to create a directed graph (`DiGraph`) where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships.
- **Common State (Memory):** The `memory` dictionary serves as a shared state accessible by all nodes, allowing for coherent data manipulation.
- **Control Flow:** Methods like `add_node` and `add_edge` manage the flow of operations, ensuring that the agent follows a predefined sequence or conditional logic.

#### 2. Persistence

- **State Saving and Loading:** The `save_state` and `load_state` methods use Python's `pickle` module to persist the graph's state to a file (`langgraph_state.pkl`). This ensures that the agent can resume operations from its last known state.
- **Short-Term and Long-Term Memory:** While `memory` handles short-term state within the agent's runtime, persistence allows for long-term memory across different sessions.

#### 3. Human-in-the-Loop

- **Human Review Method:** The `human_review` method pauses the agent's operation to allow a human to review and modify a node's attributes. This exemplifies HITL by integrating human oversight into the agent's workflow.
- **Interactive Input:** The method prompts the user to input changes, ensuring that critical decisions can be manually adjusted if necessary.

#### 4. Streaming

- **Event Streaming:** The `stream_event` method prints event messages prefixed with `[STREAM]`, simulating real-time notifications to the user or developer.
- **Token Streaming:** In the `generate_description` method, the `stream=True` parameter enables token-by-token streaming of the language model's response. This provides immediate feedback as the description is being generated.

---

### Executing and Testing the Agent

Let's walk through what happens when you execute the agent:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The agent attempts to load any existing graph state from `langgraph_state.pkl`. If none exists, it starts with an empty graph.

2. **Adding Nodes and Edges:**
   - **Nodes Added:**
     - **Alice:** An Engineer in Research and Development.
     - **Bob:** A Designer in Creative.
     - **Company:** A Technology company founded in 2010.
   - **Edges Added:**
     - **Alice → Company:** Alice works at the Company.
     - **Bob → Company:** Bob works at the Company.
     - **Alice → Bob:** Alice collaborates with Bob.

3. **Querying a Node:**
   - The agent retrieves and displays Alice's information.

4. **Generating Descriptions:**
   - The agent generates a description for the Company using OpenAI's language model. The streaming feature allows you to see the description being generated in real-time.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Interaction:**
   - The agent pauses to allow a human to review and update Bob's department. This ensures that any critical changes can be manually overseen.

6. **Generating Updated Descriptions:**
   - After the human updates Bob's department, the agent generates an updated description for Bob, reflecting the changes made.

**Sample Output:**

```
[STREAM] Graph state loaded.
[STREAM] Added node 'Alice' with attributes {'role': 'Engineer', 'department': 'Research and Development'}
[STREAM] Graph state saved.
[STREAM] Added node 'Bob' with attributes {'role': 'Designer', 'department': 'Creative'}
